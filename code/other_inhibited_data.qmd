## Is inhibition from too much DNA or from inhibitors?

### Next Gen NEPA data

Notes:

-   Qubit value is of DNA extract (total DNA) at 1:1 (i.e., not the dilution).

-   Dilution value is the dilution at which Meg ran qPCR for cutthroat based on IPC (don't know what cutoff value was but assume 0.5)

-   Many other factors (time, creek, station).

```{r}

#ngn <- read.csv(file=here("data","other_inhibited_data","ngn_inhibiton.csv"))
ngn <- read.csv("/Users/eallan/Desktop/ngn_inhibition.csv")

ggplot(ngn, aes(x=total_dna, y=dilution, color=factor(month))) + 
  geom_point() + 
  facet_wrap(~creek, scales="free") +
  scale_y_log10() + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x="Total DNA of 1:1 dilution of extract (ng/ul)", y="Dilution required for IPC to show not inhibited", color="Month of Sampling")

```
